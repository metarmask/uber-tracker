## Building
This repo doesn't include any game assets. To download a version of them, run
`download-external.js` using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org).

## CSS centric code
JavaScript isn't required to use the website. All secondary weapons stats and
behaviors are defined in CSS (bad, I know). If a CSS feature doesn't work in
certain browsers it should be replaced with JavaScript dynamically.
